## Project Blackbird

Project Blackbird is a intiative to build a distributed social network client that plugs in to the matrix network (currently it plugs in to the devnet network). The blue.js file is responsible for connecting to other clients, delivering and receiving messages ( and in the future a decentralised recomendation system).

_Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed._
